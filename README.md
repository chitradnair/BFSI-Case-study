# BFSI-Case-study
This case study attempts to build a machine learning model for BFSI institutions.
The goal is to build a bank’s internal end-to-end scoring mechanism, based on the application information, clubbed with the raw bureau information. 
The primary objective of this study is to assist Home Credit in deciding which loan applications should be disbursed, and which should be rejected, based on the applicant’s past behaviour and application information.
The study progresses by applying ‘Feature Engineering’ techniques to roll up the information at applicant level, and thereby create manual features for model building. 
Different classification models are created and the different models are evaluated to identify the best model that helps to make loan approval decisions for applicants based on their loan default behaviour.
